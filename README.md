# ðŸ“° Fake News Prediction â€“ Model Comparison

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to build and compare multiple machine learning models for **Fake News Detection**.  
The models are trained on the **Kaggle Fake News Dataset** and evaluated on standard metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)  
The dataset consists of:
- `train.csv` â€“ Training data with labels (`0` = Real News, `1` = Fake News)  
- `test.csv` â€“ Test data without labels  
- `submit.csv` â€“ Sample submission format
